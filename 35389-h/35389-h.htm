<h2>ADVANCE NOTICE<br />
<small>BY THE AUTHOR</small></h2>


<p>One afternoon shortly before the New York
"opening" of this comedy a most estimable lady
sat down to make me a cup of tea.</p>

<p>"Now, do tell me, what is your play about?"
she inquired with commendable enthusiasm. For,
being a true woman, she had early achieved the
becoming habit of letting members of the superior
sex talk about themselves.</p>

<p>"'Why Marry?'" said I, "tells the truth
about marriage."</p>

<p>"Oh, why," she expostulated, "why write unpleasant
plays?"</p>

<p>"But it is not 'unpleasant.'"</p>

<p>"Then it isn't true!" she exclaimed. "That is,
I mean&mdash;I mean&mdash;did you say cream or lemon?"</p>

<p>And in the pause which accompanied the
pouring of the cream I detected the look of one
realizing too late that it is always better to think
before speaking.</p>

<p>This little incident, it seemed to me, epitomizes
charmingly the attitude of "our nicest
people" toward our fundamental institution.
The truth about marriage must be unpleasant.
Therefore, tell us something we know isn't true.
It will be so much nicer for our young people.</p>

<p>It is to be feared, however, that young people
who go to see "Why Marry?" in the hope of being
shocked do not get their money's worth. I
have heard of but two persons who have been
scandalized by this play, and they were both old
people. One was a woman in the country who
had not seen it, but had read the title, and so
wrote several indignant letters about it. The
other was an elderly bachelor of the type which
finds useful occupation in decorating club windows
like geraniums. He took his niece to see it,
and, deciding at the end of Act II that the play
was going to be unpleasant in Act III, took her
home at once. The next afternoon she appeared
at the matin&eacute;e with a whole bevy of her own
generation and saw the rest of the play. I asked
her later if it had shocked any of them.</p>

<p>"Oh, no," she replied, "we are too young to be
shocked."</p>

<p>That little incident also struck me as socially
significant. There never were two generations
inhabiting the same globe simultaneously with
such widely separated points of view.</p>

<hr style='width: 45%;' />

<p>For several years after this play was first published
no theatrical manager on Broadway would
produce it. I don't blame them, I want to
thank them for it. I doubt if this sort of thing
could have appealed to many theatre-goers then,
especially as my young lovers are trying to
be good, not bad. "Self-expression" and "the
right to happiness" do not enter into their plans.
The causes of their courageous and, of course,
mistaken decision are unselfish and social motives,
however futile and antisocial the results
would have been had not their desperate determination
been thwarted.... When this
play was first published most people were not
thinking along these lines. Such ideas were considered
radical then. They will soon be old-fashioned&mdash;even
on the stage.</p>

<p>Kind and discriminating as the critics have
been in regard to this comedy (a discriminating
critic being, of course, one who praises your
play), few of them have seen the point which
I thought I was making emphatically clear,
namely, that we can't cure social defects by individual
treatment. Not only the lovers, but all
the characters in this play are trying to do right
according to their lights. There is no villain in
this piece. At least the villain remains "off
stage." Perhaps that is why so few see him. You
are the villain, you and I and the rest of society.
We are responsible for the rules and regulations
of the marriage game. Instead of having fun
with human nature, I tried to go higher up and
have fun with human institutions.</p>

<p>I say "tried," because apparently I did not
succeed. The joke is on me. Still, I can get some
amusement out of it: for a great many people
seem to like this play who would be indignant if
they knew what they were really applauding.
They think they are merely enjoying "satire
on human nature." Now, it is a curious fact
that you can always curse human nature with
impunity; can malign it, revile it, boot it up and
down the decalogue, and you will be warmly
praised. "How true to life!" you are told. "I
know some one just like that." (It is always
some one else, of course.) But dare lay hands on
the Existing Order&mdash;and you'll find you've laid
your hands on a hornet's nest.</p>

<p>You see, most people do not want anything
changed&mdash;except possibly the Law of Change.
They do not object to finding fault with mankind
because "you can't change human nature," as
they are fond of telling you with an interesting
air of originality. But laws, customs, and ideals
can be changed, can be improved. Therefore
they cry: "Hands off! How dare you!" Man
made human institutions, therefore we reverence
them. Whereas human nature was merely made
by God. So we don't think so much of it. We are
prejudiced, like all creators, in favor of our own
creations. After all, there is excellent precedent
for such complacency. Even God, we are informed,
pronounced his work "all very good"
and rested on the seventh day.</p>

<hr style='width: 45%;' />

<p>Pretty nearly everything in the play as acted
is in the book as published; but by no means all
that is in the book could possibly be enacted on
the stage in two hours and a half. One scene,
a breakfast scene between John and his wife,
has been amplified for acting, but all the other
scenes as printed here have been shortened for
stage purposes and one or two cut out entirely.</p>

<p>The "set" was changed to represent the loggia,
instead of the terrace, of John's "little
farm." Outdoor scenes are not supposed to be
good for comedy. Walls, or a suggestion of them,
produce a better psychological effect for the
purpose, besides making it possible to speak in
quieter, more intimate tones than when the
voice spills out into the wings and up into the
paint loft.</p>

<p>Near the end of the play a number of relatives,
rich and poor, are supposed to arrive for dinner
and for influencing by their presence the recalcitrant
couple. That is the way it is printed
and that is how it was acted during the first
few weeks of the Chicago run. But though the
family may have its place in the book, it proved
to be an awful nuisance on the stage. No matter
how well these minor parts might be acted (or
dressed), their sudden irruption during the last
and most important moments of the performance
distracted the audience's attention from
the principal characters and the main issue.
It was not clear who was who. Programmes
fluttered; perplexity was observed.... So we
decided that the family must be destroyed. It is
always a perplexing problem to devise a substitute
for the family.</p>

A night letter. Much cheaper; your Aunt Julia

Rather neat, eh? "Overdressed and underbred."
"I should love to hear <i>your</i> comments on the

sacrifices for each other? Haven't you character
enough for that?<span class='pagenum'>[Pg 32]</span></p>

<p class="char"><span class="smcap">Judge</span></p>

<p>We've been making sacrifices for twenty-five
years, a quarter of a century! Character enough
to last us now.... Why, I remember the first
dinner we had together after we were pronounced
man and wife, with a full choral service
and a great many expensive flowers&mdash;quite
a smart wedding, Lucy, for those simple
days. "Darling," I asked my blushing bride,
"do you like tutti-frutti ice-cream?" "I adore
it, dearest," she murmured. I hated it, but
nobly sacrificed myself and gave her tutti-frutti
and gained character every evening of
our honeymoon! Then when we got back and
began our "new life" together in our "little
home," my darling gave <i>me</i> tutti-frutti and indigestion
<i>once a week</i> until I nearly died!</p>

<p class="char"><span class="smcap">Lucy</span></p>

<p>But why didn't you tell her?</p>

<p class="char"><span class="smcap">Judge</span></p>

<p>I did; I did. Got chronic dyspepsia and
struck! "<i>You</i> may adore this stuff, <i>darling</i>," I
said, "but I hate it." "So do I, dearest," says
she. "Then why in thunder have you had it all<span class='pagenum'>[Pg 33]</span>
these years, <i>sweetheart</i>?" "For your sake, <i>beloved</i>!"
And that tells the whole story of our
married life. We have nothing in common but
a love of divorce and a mutual abhorrence
of tutti-frutti. "Two souls with but a single
thought, two hearts that beat as one!" It has
been the dream of our lives to get apart, and
each has nobly refrained for the other's sake.
And all in vain!</p>

<p>Perfectly practical, Theodore. The superintendent

property above human life. I'm a distinguished

<p>To separate? What an idea! On the contrary,
we wish to be free to keep together! In the old
days when they had interests in common marriage
used to make man and woman one, but
now it puts them apart. Can't you see it all
about you? He goes down-town and works; she
stays up-town and plays. He belongs to the
laboring class; she belongs to the leisure class.
At best, they seldom work at the same or similar
trades. Legally it may be a union, but
socially it's a m&eacute;salliance&mdash;in the eyes of God
it's often worse.... No wonder that one in<span class='pagenum'>[Pg 150]</span>
eleven ends in divorce. The only way to avoid
spiritual separation is to shun legal union like a
contagious disease. Modern marriage <i>is</i> divorce.

driven forth from the tribe, they indignantly
refused to be driven into each other's arms until

never was, there never will be a more perfect
tribute to true marriage than from this fearless
pair you now accuse of seeking to destroy it!

1.B.  "Project Gutenberg" is a registered trademark.  It may only be
used on or associated in any way with an electronic work by people who
agree to be bound by the terms of this agreement.  There are a few
things that you can do with most Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works

individual work is in the public domain in the United States and you are
located in the United States, we do not claim a right to prevent you from
copying, distributing, performing, displaying or creating derivative
works based on the work as long as all references to Project Gutenberg
are removed.  Of course, we hope that you will support the Project
Gutenberg-tm mission of promoting free access to electronic works by
freely sharing Project Gutenberg-tm works in compliance with the terms of
this agreement for keeping the Project Gutenberg-tm name associated with
the work.  You can easily comply with the terms of this agreement by
keeping this work in the same format with its attached full Project
Gutenberg-tm License when you share it without charge with others.

before downloading, copying, displaying, performing, distributing or
creating derivative works based on this work or any other Project
Gutenberg-tm work.  The Foundation makes no representations concerning
the copyright status of any work in any country outside the United
States.

or charges.  If you are redistributing or providing access to a work

1.F.

1.F.1.  Project Gutenberg volunteers and employees expend considerable
effort to identify, do copyright research on, transcribe and proofread
public domain works in creating the Project Gutenberg-tm
collection.  Despite these efforts, Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works, and the medium on which they may be stored, may contain
"Defects," such as, but not limited to, incomplete, inaccurate or
corrupt data, transcription errors, a copyright or other intellectual
property infringement, a defective or damaged disk or other medium, a
computer virus, or computer codes that damage or cannot be read by
your equipment.

1.F.2.  LIMITED WARRANTY, DISCLAIMER OF DAMAGES - Except for the "Right
of Replacement or Refund" described in paragraph 1.F.3, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation, the owner of the Project
Gutenberg-tm trademark, and any other party distributing a Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic work under this agreement, disclaim all
liability to you for damages, costs and expenses, including legal
fees.  YOU AGREE THAT YOU HAVE NO REMEDIES FOR NEGLIGENCE, STRICT
LIABILITY, BREACH OF WARRANTY OR BREACH OF CONTRACT EXCEPT THOSE
PROVIDED IN PARAGRAPH 1.F.3.  YOU AGREE THAT THE FOUNDATION, THE

defect in this electronic work within 90 days of receiving it, you can
receive a refund of the money (if any) you paid for it by sending a
written explanation to the person you received the work from.  If you
received the work on a physical medium, you must return the medium with
your written explanation.  The person or entity that provided you with
the defective work may elect to provide a replacement copy in lieu of a
refund.  If you received the work electronically, the person or entity
providing it to you may choose to give you a second opportunity to
receive the work electronically in lieu of a refund.  If the second copy
is also defective, you may demand a refund in writing without further
opportunities to fix the problem.

1.F.4.  Except for the limited right of replacement or refund set forth
in paragraph 1.F.3, this work is provided to you 'AS-IS' WITH NO OTHER
WARRANTIES OF ANY KIND, EXPRESS OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING BUT NOT LIMITED TO

warranties or the exclusion or limitation of certain types of damages.
If any disclaimer or limitation set forth in this agreement violates the
law of the state applicable to this agreement, the agreement shall be
interpreted to make the maximum disclaimer or limitation permitted by
the applicable state law.  The invalidity or unenforceability of any
provision of this agreement shall not void the remaining provisions.

1.F.6.  INDEMNITY - You agree to indemnify and hold the Foundation, the
trademark owner, any agent or employee of the Foundation, anyone
providing copies of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works in accordance
with this agreement, and any volunteers associated with the production,
promotion and distribution of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works,
harmless from all liability, costs and expenses, including legal fees,
that arise directly or indirectly from any of the following which you do
or cause to occur: (a) distribution of this or any Project Gutenberg-tm
work, (b) alteration, modification, or additions or deletions to any
Project Gutenberg-tm work, and (c) any Defect you cause.


Section  2.  Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg-tm

Project Gutenberg-tm is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of computers
including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers.  It exists
because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations from
people in all walks of life.

Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need are critical to reaching Project Gutenberg-tm's
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg-tm collection will
remain freely available for generations to come.  In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg-tm and future generations.

Section 4.  Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg
Literary Archive Foundation

Project Gutenberg-tm depends upon and cannot survive without wide
spread public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment.  Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.

The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States.  Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements.  We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance.  To
SEND DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any
particular state visit http://pglaf.org

While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.

International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States.  U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.

Please check the Project Gutenberg Web pages for current donation
methods and addresses.  Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including including checks, online payments and credit card
donations.  To donate, please visit: http://pglaf.org/donate


Section 5.  General Information About Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works.

Professor Michael S. Hart is the originator of the Project Gutenberg-tm
concept of a library of electronic works that could be freely shared
with anyone.  For thirty years, he produced and distributed Project
Gutenberg-tm eBooks with only a loose network of volunteer support.


Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as Public Domain in the U.S.
unless a copyright notice is included.  Thus, we do not necessarily
keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper edition.


Most people start at our Web site which has the main PG search facility:

     http://www.gutenberg.net

This Web site includes information about Project Gutenberg-tm,
including how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to
subscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.
